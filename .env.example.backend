# Backend Environment Configuration Example
# This file should be copied to .env in the backend directory and values updated as necessary.

# --- Application Settings ---
# Port the backend FastAPI server will run on
PORT=8000

# Base URL for the backend API (used for constructing full URLs if needed, e.g., for external callbacks)
# This should match where the backend is accessible from the outside world or other services.
# If running locally and frontend uses VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000", this might also be http://localhost:8000
API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# Environment mode: development, staging, or production
ENVIRONMENT="development"

# --- Security Settings ---
# Secret key for JWT token generation and validation. KEEP THIS SECRET!
# Generate a strong random key, e.g., using: openssl rand -hex 32
JWT_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_VERY_SECRET_RANDOM_KEY_HERE"
ALGORITHM="HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1440 # 24 hours

# --- Database Settings ---
# Example for PostgreSQL. Adjust according to your database choice.
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name"
# For local development with a mock DB or SQLite, this might not be strictly needed immediately
# but is crucial for real data persistence.
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./test_db.db" # Example for a local SQLite DB for quickstart

# --- External API Keys (Keep these server-side) ---
# These keys should NOT be exposed to the frontend.
# The backend services will use these keys to fetch data from external providers.

# For News & Sentiment Routes (Reddit)
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"
REDDIT_USER_AGENT="YOUR_REDDIT_USER_AGENT (e.g., MyBettingApp/0.1 by YourUsername)"

# For Data Scraping Route (TheOddsAPI)
THEODDS_API_KEY="YOUR_THEODDS_API_KEY"

# Other examples (uncomment and use if these services are integrated)
# SPORTRADAR_API_KEY="YOUR_SPORTRADAR_KEY_HERE"
# NEWS_API_KEY="YOUR_NEWSAPI_ORG_KEY_HERE"
# OTHER_DATA_SERVICE_API_KEY="YOUR_OTHER_KEY_HERE"

# --- Sentry for Backend Error Tracking (Optional) ---
# SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND="YOUR_BACKEND_SENTRY_DSN_HERE"

# --- WebSocket Settings ---
# No specific WS server settings here if using FastAPI's built-in WebSocket support which runs on the same host/port.

# --- ML Model Settings ---
# Path to the directory where ML models are stored (relative to backend root or absolute)
MODELS_STORE_PATH="advanced/models_store/"

# --- CORS Settings ---
# Origins allowed to connect to the backend. For development, often includes frontend dev server.
# Example: "http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173"
# Use "*" for allowing all origins (less secure, typically for public APIs or during early dev).
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173"
